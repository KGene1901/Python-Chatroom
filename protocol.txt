Instant Messenger (IM) Application Protocol
--------------------------------------------

This document outlines the protocol defined for communication between the client(s) and the IM server:

1. 	Messages that can be sent within the application:
		=> normal (text-based) words/sentences which covers:
			- the modern English alphabet (a-z / A-Z)
			- numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)
			- and any special keyboard symbols (!, ?, @, ...)

		=> in-app user commands:
			- /help ==> To list all available user commands
			- /rename <new username> ==> To change your own username (NOTE: The username should contain no spaces - otherwise it will be cut off)
			- /whisper <the username of the person who you wish to whisper to> <message> ==> To privately message another user in the chatroom
			- /listUsers ==> To list all current users in the chatroom
			- /quit ==> To exit the chatroom

2.	Responses:
		=> When a client first joins the server:
			- he/she will be greeted with the welcome message: "{username} has joined! Type /help for a list of chatroom commands.
			- all connected clients (excluding the newly connected one) will also be notified of this incoming connection with the message "{username} has joined"

		=> When a client sends a normal message:
			- the server will broadcast this message to all clients connected (including the sender) to the server which should lead to the message being displayed on every client

		=> When a client sends a user command:
			- /help 

			>> the server will send back a string (separated by line breaks "\n") which contains a list of user commands with their respective descriptions to only the client that requested for it (it is not broadcasted)
			
			- /rename <username> 

			>> if the username is already taken by another client, the server will send the error message "This username has been taken. Please try again with /rename <username>" back to the client who requested for the change

			==> if the username is available, the server will allow it to happen and broadcast the message "{old username} has changed their username to {new username}" to all connected clients (even the client who requested for the name change)

			- /whisper <username> <message> 

			>> if the user requested is not in the server, the server will reject the request and send the error message "This user does not exist" to the client that requested the private message. Nothing will be sent.

			>> if the client tries to privately message his/her ownself, the server will reject the request and send the error message "Not allowed to private message your ownself!" to that client. Nothing will be sent.

			>> if a private message is empty, the server will send the error message "Not allowed to send empty message(s)" back to the sender. Nothing will be sent.

			>> if the user requested is available, the server will send the message from sender client to the receiver client (1 to 1 communication) with the format "(private) {username}: {message}" (Both the clients should receive the private message)

			- /listUsers 

			>> the server will send back a string (separated by line breaks "\n") containing a list of usernames (connected clients) to the client that requested for it

			- /quit 

			>> a client's disconnection will be detected by the server and it will pop the client's information from its temporary memory followed by broadcasting the message "{username} has disconnected" to all remaining connected clients

3. 	Clients are allowed to send messages in the formats as described in PART 1 above while the server sends messages as defined in the RESPONSES part of the document. 

4. 	Design choices:
	
   		- My decision to choose multi-threading over select() to handle multiple client connections was due to the fact it allows blocking I/O to be use which is more straightforward to implement and that operations in different threads are able to run concurrently, this makes the program sturcture appear more neater and simplified.

   		- Aside from regular messages, user commands (except "/quit") are also coded to be handled by the server to keep the client code clean and ensure all main logic/functionalities are centralized and standardized in the server side to allow easy code updates and improvements. 

   		- I created a separate function for broadcasting messages in the server side code to reduce code redundancy and for ease of use as it is dynamic (it can take in any string messages) and it complements the built-in send/sendall function when sending to all connected clients at once. 

   		- In terms of the client side, I made a simple GUI to allow better readability of chat and to make the application look more formal overall. 
   		
   		- Thorough error checking was implemented to ensure good usability, for example, empty messages cannot be sent, proper parameters must be provided to start up the server or client, etc.
